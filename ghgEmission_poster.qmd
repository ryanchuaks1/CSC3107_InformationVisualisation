# Introduction

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes significantly contribute to climate change. The primary GHGs—carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), and fluorinated gases—trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. This results in rising global temperatures, disrupted weather patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. For instance, global temperatures have increased by approximately 1.2°C since the late 19th century [^Jones1999Surface], and sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters over the past century due to melting polar ice caps and glaciers, threatening various species' habitats. Beyond climate change, GHG emissions affect air quality and public health, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution causes around 3.3 million premature deaths annually [^Lelieveld2015The]. Additionally, the increased concentration of GHGs disrupts ecosystems and endangers biodiversity. Ocean acidification, resulting from excess CO$_2$ absorption by oceans, has risen by 30% since the Industrial Revolution [^Popattanachai2021Ocean], adversely impacting marine life, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.

Visualizing GHG emissions is essential for understanding their distribution across countries and sectors, identifying major contributors, and informing policy decisions. The top 10 emitting countries—China, the United States, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, European Union (EU), Canada, and Brazil—account for a significant portion of global emissions. Major sectors contributing to these emissions include energy production, transportation, industrial processes, agriculture, and waste management. The energy sector is the largest source due to fossil fuel combustion, while the transportation sector significantly contributes through gasoline and diesel use. Highlighting these contributors underscores the need for coordinated climate action and promotes sustainable practices, renewable energy, and effective policies.

# Suggested Improvements
<!-- TODO: Modify according to Treemap Plot -->

<!-- We decided to exclude the "Others" category from the previous visualization to enhance clarity and focus on the top 10 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. This adjustment allows for a more straightforward comparison of emissions across these leading countries and their respective sectors. Additionally, we included a stacked bar chart to display the emissions by sector for these top 10 countries in comparison to the rest of the world. This approach provides a clearer understanding of the major contributors to global emissions and highlights the differences between the top emitters and other countries. -->

<!-- To remove the clustering of information in the original visualization, we changed the visualization used, from a stacked donut chart to a treemap. At the same time, we have decided to choose 5 common sectors and categorize the remaining to be "Other Sectors". The message of the original visualization is still retained in our treemap which shows that the top 10 countries contributes 2/3 of the global emissions. The adjustments made provide a clearer and non-clustered visualization. -->


<!-- 1. **Removed "Others" category:** Enhanced clarity by focusing on the top 10 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. -->
<!-- 2. **Donut chart:** Visualized the top 10 countries and their emission sectors, allowing for straightforward comparison. -->
<!-- 3. **Stacked bar chart:** Added to show emissions by sector for the top 10 countries compared to the rest of the world. -->
<!-- 4. **Enhanced comparison:** Improved understanding of major contributors to global emissions. -->
<!-- 5. **Clear visualization:** Highlighted differences between top emitters and other countries. -->

<!-- 1. **Treemap:** Visualized the top 10 countries and their emissions sectors covering 2/3 of the chart, allowing for clearer comparison. -->
<!-- 2. **Picked common sectors:** Selected 5 common sectors and categorized the rest as "Other Sectors" for a more focused visualization. -->
<!-- 3. **Colored legends:** Provided color-coded legends for easy identification of sectors. -->
<!-- 4. **Grey area:** The remaining 184 countries are greyed out to emphasize the top 10 countries. -->

1. *Transitioned to a treemap* from a stacked donut chart to address the clustering of information.
2. Selected five common sectors, *categorizing the remaining* as "Other Sectors," resulting in a clearer visualization and focused comparison of emissions.
3. The treemap illustrates the top 10 countries and their emission sectors, *emphasizing that they contribute two-thirds* of global emissions.
4. *Color-coded legends* were provided for easy sector identification.
5. The remaining 184 countries are *greyed out*, highlighting the top 10 countries.
6. Used Color Brewer's *Set3* for sectors to *enhance visual distinction and comprehension*.
7. Applied *black outer borders* to differentiate countries clearly.
8. Used *white inner borders* to separate sectors distinctly within each country.
9. Included *subtitles and legends* to aid reader understanding of the plot.

# Implementation

## Data

Data was retrieved from the World Bank Data website[^climatewatchdata], encompassing greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, F-Gas, N2O, CH4) by sector for various countries. Negative values were removed to ensure accuracy, and the top 10 countries with the highest emissions were selected for analysis.

[^climatewatchdata]: <https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2021&start_year=1990>

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language, along with the following third-party packages:

<!-- TODO: Modify according to Treemap Plot -->

* *readxl* for data import

# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

To enhance user engagement and provide deeper insights, we recommend incorporating interactive features into the treemap visualization. Specifically, these features will enable users to explore emissions data more effectively. Interactive elements could include hover information to display detailed emissions data, including sector and country specifics, and percentage of world emissions. Additionally, filtering options will allow users to focus on specific countries, sectors, or emission types, with elements highlighted on hover to emphasize selected data. Clickable elements could be implemented to allow users to select the same sectors in other countries for size comparison, significantly improving the usability and informational depth of the visualization.

# Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Modify according to Treemap Plot -->
<!-- We have refined the visualization of the top 10 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions to offer a clearer and more focused depiction of emissions by sector. By removing the "Others" category and emphasizing the leading emitters, we have improved the visualization's clarity and highlighted the primary contributors to global emissions. The inclusion of a donut chart and stacked bar chart provides a comprehensive overview of sector-specific emissions for these countries, facilitating effective comparisons across both countries and sectors. To enhance user engagement and facilitate data exploration, we recommend integrating interactive features. Visualizing greenhouse gas emissions plays a crucial role in raising awareness about climate change, advocating for sustainable practices, and informing policy decisions aimed at mitigating environmental impacts caused by human activities. -->

We have refined the visualization of the top 10 countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions that contributes two-third of the global emissions. By using a treemap, we have provided a non-clustered and clearer visualization without swaying away from the message of the original visualization. By picking the 5 common sectors and categorizing the remaing as one, contributes to a non-clustered visualization. Color-coded legends are provided for easy identification of sectors. The remaining 184 countries are greyed out to emphasize that the top 10 countries contributed two-third of the global emissions. To enhance user engagement and facilitate data exploration, we recommend integrating interactive features. To end it off, visualizing greenhouse gas emissions plays a crucial role in raising awareness about climate change, advocating for sustainable practices, and informing policy decisions aimed at mitigating environmental impacts caused by human activities.

# Introduction

This Quarto document contains the data engineering required to reconstruct and improve the plot made by [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/insights/4-charts-explain-greenhouse-gas-emissions-countries-and-sectors), shown in @fig-oldvs, showing the top 10 Green House Gases (GHG) emitters in the world.

The code below requires the following packages:
```{r}
#| label: library
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(gt)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-oldvs
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Visualization of The Top 10 GHG Emitters Contribute Over Two-Thirds of Global Emissions."

# Data Exploration

## Source 1 (Main Source) {#source1}

Firstly, lets take a look at the raw data provided from [climatewatchdata.org](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions)

```{r}
#| label: explore-raw
#| message: false

ghg_raw <- read_csv("data/historical_emissions.csv")
gt_preview(ghg_raw)
```

From the preview, lets check how many unique Countries, Sectors, Gases and Unit are there in the dataset

```{r}
#| label: explore-unique
#| message: false

ghg_raw |>
  summarize(
    n_distinct(Country),
  )
ghg_raw |>
  summarize(
    n_distinct(Sector),
    n_distinct(Gas),
    n_distinct(Unit)
  )
```

Since there is only 1 distinct `Sector`, `Gas` and `Unit` type, we can drop those columns along with the `Source` column as it is not needed for our analysis. The unit MtCOâ‚‚e stands for "million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent."

## Source 2 (Alternative Source) {#source2}

Next, we will take a look at another source, where the data is slightly more updated, up to 2022.[ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions)

```{r}
#| label: explore-raw2
#| message: false

ghg_raw2 <- read_csv("data/historical_emissions_source2.csv")
gt_preview(ghg_raw2)
```

Lets check the unique number of countries as well

```{r}
#| label: explore-unique2
#| message: false

ghg_raw2 |>
  summarize(
    n_distinct(Entity),
  )
```

Since there are more countries covered, we can potentially keep the data from this source and merge it with the first source.

## Source 3 (Alternative Source) {#source3}

Lastly, we will take a look at the third source, where the data has more details

```{r}
#| label: explore-raw3
#| message: false

ghg_raw3 <- read_csv("data/historical_emissions_source3.csv")
gt_preview(ghg_raw3)
```

From the preview we can see that there are many features, lets extract out the relevant ones to preview

```{r}
ghg_raw3 <-
  ghg_raw3 |>
  select(Country, Industry, Gas_Type, F1970:F2022)

gt_preview(ghg_raw3)
```

From this we can tell that this data source not only have the countries, but it is split by the gas type and industry

## Conclusion from exploration

[Source 1](#source1) and [Source 2](#source2) have similar data, both consisting of each country's annual GHG emission. These data are suitable for a simple analysis while [Source 3](#source3) is more detailed, with the data split by industry and gas type.

We can potentially merge Source 1 and 2 together to get a more complete dataset, and then explore Source 3 for more detailed analysis/different angles.

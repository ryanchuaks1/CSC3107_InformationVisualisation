## Introduction

Greenhouse Gases ($CO_2$) data visualisation:

![](./figures/Visualisation_Graph.png){fig-align="center"}

<em>Data source: [theGuardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/oct/03/tracking-australias-progress-on-the-climate-crisis-and-the-consequences-of-global-heating) </em>

# Critical Analysis

## What data are visualized?

$CO_2$ emissions by country (x-axis)

- Bigger Circles = Larger Emissions
- Red Circles = Increase in Emissions
- Blue Circles = Decrease in Emissions


## What does the visualization aim to communicate? {.smaller}

The visualization aims to communicate the $CO_2$ emissions by country, and the changes in emissions over time through 2 methods:

1. Circle Size (Larger Circle = Larger Emissions)
2. Circle Color (Red = Increase, Blue = Decrease)

## What aspects of the visualization do you appreciate?

The use of shape size and color to represent the increase/decrease in emissions:

- **Clear Trend Display**: Shows a clear trend of how greenhouse gas emissions have changed over time for a selection of countries.
- **Color Coding**: Differentiates between increases and decreases using color coding.

## What aspects do you find problematic?

::: {.nonincremental}
- **Limited Country Selection**
- **Unspecified Greenhouse Gases**
- **Visual Clutter**
- **Lack of Contextual Information**
- **No Trend Lines**
:::

::: {.notes}
- **Limited Country Selection**: Only includes a selection of countries, not all.
- **Unspecified Greenhouse Gases**: Does not specify which other greenhouse gases are included in the CO2 equivalent mentioned in the title.
- **Visual Clutter**: Sequential bubbles create visual clutter, especially for countries with larger changes, making it hard to distinguish individual years and magnitudes.
- **Lack of Contextual Information**: Only shows percentage changes without absolute emission values, making it difficult to gauge the actual impact.
- **No Trend Lines**: Absence of trend lines makes it difficult to see overall trends for each country over the years.
:::


## How can the visualization be improved?

- **Line Graph with Trend Lines**: Using a line graph with trend lines for each country can help show the overall trend over the years more clearly. Each line could be color-coded to indicate the average trend (increasing or decreasing). 
- **World Map Representation**: Use a world map to show the changes in emissions by country.

## Are the data publicly available, or are there suitable surrogate data? {.smaller}

### Original Data View

```{r}
#| label: original-data

emissions <- read_csv("dataset/total-ghg-emissions.csv")

# Select random 5 rows
emissions |>
  slice_sample(n = 5) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Original Data") |>
  fmt_number(
    columns = "Annual greenhouse gas emissions in CO₂ equivalents",
    decimals = 0,
    use_seps = TRUE
  ) |>

  # Footnote
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = md("Gas emissions in kilogram $CO_2$ equivalents."),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = "Annual greenhouse gas emissions in CO₂ equivalents")
  ) |>
  # Source
